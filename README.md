GitHub Training

Richard Morrison here.

I am a project manager getting familiar with GitHub.
I have been doing project management in the IT (Hi Tech) sector for over 15 years. Now I want to get a bit more coding under my belt and as my development has gotten larger so has my need for a proper version control system. I am expecting that GitHub will be this solution.

Thank you.
